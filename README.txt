While Go is the common English name for the game, I chose "baduk", the Korean term, to get around how common the word "go" is in English. 
baduk-draw.rkt is the main program to run, and it uses baduk-base and baduk-sgf-ops. baduk-sgf-ops is incomplete at this time. There are 
also problems with capturing stones at the very edge of the board.
